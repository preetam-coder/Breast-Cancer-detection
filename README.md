📌 Logistic Regression Binary Classifier – Breast Cancer Prediction

A Machine Learning Project using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib

📁 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression.
The goal is to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

This dataset contains various features computed from breast mass images (like radius, texture, symmetry, etc.).
Using logistic regression, we classify each sample into one of two categories:

1 → Malignant (cancer detected)

0 → Benign (no cancer)

🎯 Objective

Choose and load a binary classification dataset

Preprocess and standardize the features

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate using:

Confusion Matrix
